		Code Challenge #1:

		Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, please recreate the small blog application seen in the image below.
		If needed, feel free to use Google for help. Please give your best effort without looking at other code
		examples. The primary goal of this challenge is to get an understanding of your level of comfort with
		CSS and JS. We don't expect it to be perfect but, please be prepared to explain your solution.

		-The articles images should always maintain the proper aspect ratio of 16 x 9 even though the original
		 (source) image might not have the correct aspect radio.
